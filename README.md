## C programs on Process Scheduling

Includes:
+ FCFS scheduling
+ SJF & SRTF scheduling (tie-breaker: Priority for both)
+ Static Priority (non-preemptive) & Dynamic Priority (preemptive) scheduling (tie-breaker: SJF for both [used remaining time fttb])
+ Round-Robin scheduling
+ Multi-Level Queue scheduling (tie-breaker: as per above)
  * OS process queue: Non-preemptive Priority
  * Interactive process queue: Round-Robin
  * Batch process queue: FCFS
#
Determined:
+ Process waiting time
+ Average process waiting time
+ Process turnaround time
+ Average process turnaround time
+ CPU utilization time & utilization percentage
+ CPU idle time
+ Points of context switches (indicating the switches)
+ Points of mode switches (indicating the switches)
