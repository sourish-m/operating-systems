Includes:
+ FCFS scheduling
+ SJF & SRTF scheduling (tie-breaker: Priority for both)
+ Static Priority (non-preemptive) & Dynamic Priority (preemptive) scheduling (tie-breaker: SJF for both [burst time])
+ Round-Robin scheduling
+ Multi-Level Queue scheduling (tie-breaker: as per above) || Not working, feel free to make it work
  * OS process queue: Non-preemptive Priority
  * Interactive process queue: Round-Robin
  * Batch process queue: FCFS
#
Determined:
